Re: Java RXTX installed from repository, how to import?
Alright, got some help and figured out how to do this.

Firstly I had to add the Java library (the .jar file) located at
Code:
/usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar
by right-clicking Libraries -> add Jar/Folder.

I was able to clean and build the program, but it would fail when executed.

To fix this problem, I added the line
Code:
-Djava.library.path="/usr/lib/jni/"
to the VM Options. (Right click project -> Properties -> Run). 
This is the path to the librxtxSerial.so file.

Sincerely,
Jon
